    "# Speech Processing Labs: How to use these notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository includes lab notebooks for the University of Edinburgh course: Speech Processing (LASC11158/LASC10061). You should work through these notebooks in the weekly lab sessions of the course. You'll get the most out of these notebooks if you watch the videos associated with the notebook topics (on [speech.zone](https://speech.zone/courses/speech-processing/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks were primarily developed for the [signal processing](./signals) modules of the course.  These have an interactive component that you can run directly in the notebook. We will also publish the lab exercises for the [phonetics/phonology](./phon) content here, but these require you to use some external tools (e.g. Praat). \n",
    "\n",
    "The TTS labs will focus on the first assignment, in which you will investigate the [Festival text-to-speech system](https://speech.zone/exercises/the-festival-text-to-speech-system/).  The ASR labs help you with the second assignment, where you will use HTK to [build a digit recognizer](https://speech.zone/exercises/digit-recogniser/). The details the TTS and ASR assignments can be found in the [Practical Exercises](https://speech.zone/exercises/) section of [speech.zone](https://speech.zone/courses/speech-processing/)). \n",

These provide an interactive way to run python code and write nicely formatted text using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).  Once you've got your own copy of the notebooks you can use them to run the interactive bits and also make your own notes for your tutorials (or develop your own code if you like!)\n",

    "\n",
    "To get your own copy of the repository you will need to 'clone' it using git commands. How you do this will depend a little on how you want to run them.  Here are the two main options. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Run the notebooks online using Edina Noteable\n",
    "\n",
    "University of Edinburgh students have access to [Edina Noteable](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/learning-technology/noteable): the university's online Jupyter Notebook server. This allows you to use Jupyter Notebooks, Python and all the extra packages we need through your browser (you don't need to install anything on your side).  \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\" role=\"alert\">\n",
    "If your internet connection is fairly fast and stable, using Edina Noteable for this is probably your best option (just remember to save any changes you make to your notebooks often!).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find lots of information on how to use Edina Noteable (including some videos) [here](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/user_guide/#hide_ge_2).  \n",
    "\n",
    "As of 2023, you will need to access Noteable via Learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "How to get these notebooks on Noteable: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Start up Noteable either by:\n",
    "    * Go to the Learn page for this course and click on the \"Noteable LTI 1.3\" link\n",
    "    * Go to the following URL in your browser login in with your EASE username and password:\n",
    "      * https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login\n",
    "      * **NOTE: As of 2023 You will need to be logged into Learn for this to work**. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Select Standard Notebook (if you're given an option) and click on the start button.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You'll then see the jupyter start directory, showing you links to the files in it (probably empty at this point). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cloning the repository ###\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest getting the repository using the Noteable terminal interface so that you can easily get any updates to the notebooks in the repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "The terminal interface allows you to type in and run [unix shell commands](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/course-shell/). To start the terminal click on the `new` drop down menu (found to the right of the +GitRepo button) and start a new terminal instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should then see a unix shell interface in the browser.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can then get the repo by typing or copy/paste in the following command: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/laic/uoe_speech_processing_course\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This basically tells the computer to get the files at that URL and make a copy in your current directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get updates, you'll need open terminal and change directory `cd` to our notebook folder \n",
    "```\n",
    "cd uoe_speech_processing_course\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can see the files in that directory by using the `ls` command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "When you're in the `uoe_speech_processing_course` directory, you can get updates by running the following in the terminal:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully there won't be too many updates for you to get, but it's good to get used to using version control systems (particularly git), especially if you're planning on doing computational things in the future (e.g. an MSc SLP dissertation!). Most open-source code is shared through github nowadays. Once you've got the hang of it, it can also be a lot easier to use the terminal to do a lot of things, e.g. organize your files using shell commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the terminal more for the TTS and ASR labs.  But for the Signals labs you can now close the terminal window and go back to the notebook page.  You should see the `uoe_speech_processing_course` appear in your files (refresh the page if not)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\">\n",
    "If you're using Noteable, you might as well just use it through your normal computer browser (i.e. not through the remote desktop).  It'll save your computer a little bit of work. \n",

    "### Running Jupyter Notebooks on your own computer\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also run Jupyter Notebooks locally on your own computer. Once you have everything installed, you should be able to go through all the lab materials offline. To do this, you'll need to have a few things installed: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Python 3.x (e.g. Python 3.8 should be fine, we last tested with Python 3.9)\n",
    "* Jupyter notebook\n",
    "* numpy\n",
    "* matplotlib\n",
    "* librosa\n",
    "  \n",
    "If you already have Python 3 installed, you could just use `pip` to get the rest.  But, I'd recommend using some version of anaconda (e.g. miniconda, the lightweight version of anaconda) because it will be useful for many other things later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note for Windows Users\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these instructions assume that you're using a unix like environment (i.e. the bash shell).  If you're using a Windows machine, you'll need to use a shell emulator.  Many people use VS Code which has many helpful extensions.  This will likely work for running python notebooks (though we haven't had a chance to test this as all the staff for this course use Macs!). You can find some documentation here: [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) \n",
    "\n",
    "You could also try is [Ubuntu WSL](https://ubuntu.com/wsl), which basically allows you to run Ubuntu linux (a unix variant) on Windows.  This may require non-trivial amount of work to get running though.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to use the bash emulator that comes with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).  This also comes with graphical user interface for git which you might find handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use this, you can try these [instructions for installing bash, git, conda and python on windows](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/setup-earth-analytics-python/setup-git-bash-conda/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install Python 3.9 and Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the Miniconda 3.9 installer (Other newer versions of python should work too). You'll need to choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Window, MacOs or Linux) and the number of bits your CPU uses (64 or 32).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find installation instructions for different operating systems (e.g. Windows) here:\n",
    "* https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic instructions for installing miniconda on the unix shell:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've downloaded the installer, open up a terminal and go to the directory you installed it into (probably `Downloads`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following command to check the downloaded file isn't corrupted.  You can check that the string it returns matches SHA256 hash listed next to the download link you used. \n",
    "```\n",
    "sha256sum ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Change the permissions on the Miniconda installer so you can run it ('u' for user, 'x' for execute): \n",
    "```\n",
    "chmod u+x ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And then run the installer script: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "The installer will ask you a bunch of questions (agree to the license etc) which you basically have to say yes to if you want to use Miniconda.  You can also choose where it installs Miniconda, but usually the default location (in your home directory) is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Create a conda environment\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll then need to close and reopen your terminal.  Now run the following command to create a new Python 3.8 environment called `slp` (actually you can call it whatever you want!). \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n slp python=3.9\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, activate the environment. \n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate slp\n",
    "```\n",
    "Doing this basically means that you're telling the shell to use this version of python instead of the default version of python on your computer.  Activating the environment also means you can download python packages in a systematic way and you (probably) won't run into permission problems on computers where you don't have administrator access.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it's good practice you use python enviroments for your projects so that you can keep track of dependencies.  New updates to python packages can sometimes mess up how old code works, so if you want someone else to run your code, having a specific conda environment means someone  else (maybe even your future self?) can easily recreate the conditions in which your code was created on a different machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install Jupyter Notebooks and other dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need can use conda to install a bunch of stuff, i.e. jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge  notebook numpy matplotlib ipython ffmpeg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can finally startup jupyter notebooks! Note you need to be in the slp environment we just created for this to work (i.e. run `conda activate slp` before this). \n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command starts a local notebook server and will give you a link to it. Open that link in your browser and you're all set!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You'll need to get the notebook repository from github.  First, you'll need to [install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). After that, go to the directory you want to download the notebooks into and run the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/laic/uoe_speech_processing_course\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should now see a directory call `uoe_speech_processing_course` in the directory where you called the `git clone` command. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also potentially use a [github desktop user interface](https://desktop.github.com) to clone the repository. \n",

You can ask questions in the labs, the lecture, as well as the forum on the [speech zone website](http://speech.zone/courses/speech-processing/).  The speech.zone forum has questions and answers from many previous years of the course, so you may find that your question has already been answered there. If you want some more 1-1 help, you can always book an appointment with the course lecturers. \n",
