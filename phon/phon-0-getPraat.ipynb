    "Getting sounds into Praat\n",
    "=========================\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to get some sound files to work with. There are two ways\n",
    "to do this: open an existing sound file, or a record a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Praat is capable of handling most sound file formats,\n",
    "including MP3 and other familiar file types. However, it is best\n",
    "practice to use lossless, uncompressed formats such as WAV, AIFF, or\n",
    "FLAC to ensure high quality sound and reliable analyses. For the\n",
    "purposes of the PHON tutorials, we'll be using WAV files exclusively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Record a new sound\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're just starting out you might not have any sound files readily\n",
    "available to work with, so you will need to record your own. You could\n",
    "do this with any kind of recording software and equipment, but Praat\n",
    "also provides this functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  At the top of the Praat Objects window, click on `New`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Select `Record mono Sound...` from the drop down menu that appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  A new SoundRecorder window will appear with a white window labeled\n",
    "    'Meter' at the center and a few options for you to select. By\n",
    "    default, the following options should be preselected:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Channels: Mono\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  Input source: Built-in Microphone\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.  Sampling frequency: 44100 Hz\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the bottom right corner of the SoundRecorder, there is also a\n",
    "    field labeled `Name:` where you can input a name for the sound. This\n",
    "    name will appear in the Praat Objects window after you have saved\n",
    "    your recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  The Meter window should show a message that reads 'Not recording.'\n",
    "    Click on `Record`. Now the Meter window in the center of the\n",
    "    SoundRecorder should be monitoring the sound coming from your\n",
    "    microphone. Clap your hands a few times to watch the levels spike\n",
    "    and turn red. This is an indication that the sound you have recorded\n",
    "    was too loud and will be distorted or clipped. Try to keep your\n",
    "    recordings in the green or yellow range. Click on `Stop` to stop\n",
    "    recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Now record yourself saying 'Hello, world!' (or anything else you'd\n",
    "    like to say) and save the recording to the Praat Objects list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Type a name into the `Name:` field\n",
    "    2.  Click on `Record`\n",

    "    the sound that you recorded.\n",

    "    Objects list. Simply select the item and then click on `Rename...`\n",

    "6.  If you would like to revisit this file later, be sure to save it\n",
    "    from the Objects window.\n",

    "\n",
    "    -   The **top bar** will play a section of the sound that is visible\n",

    "        is split into sections;\n",
    "\n",

    "        currently visible in the window;\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Select a portion of the waveform by clicking and dragging along in\n",
