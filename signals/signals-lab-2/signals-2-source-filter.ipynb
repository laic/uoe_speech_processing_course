If you've played around with that before, you'll know that you need to tell it how many formants (i.e. peaks) you want to find.  This corresponds to the \"order\" parameter in the LPC function above.  In general, you need 2 coefficients per peak.  So, to determine 5 formants, we need an order 10 filter.  \n",

The term we discard is there  because what LPC estimates an equivalent but slightly different form of the filter. Because of this we will also need to multiply the coefficients by -1 in our IIR function. This is beyond the scope of this course but you can find more details on this in, for example, [Taylor's Speech Synthesis textbook (Chapter 12)](https://speech.zone/readings/taylor-text-to-speech-synthesis/chapter-12-analysis-of-speech-signals/taylor-section-12-4-linear-prediction-analysis/)\n",
