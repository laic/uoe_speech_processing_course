    "\n",
    "People taking the Speech Processing course come from lots of different backgrounds. While we assume everybody has a bit of programming experience, we've tried to design these labs so that you don't actually need to write code to work through them. Hopefully the code blocks have enough comments that you'll be able to follow even if you don't have much coding experience. Mostly you'll just need to change some variables here and there to do the exercises.  But, of course, you're welcome to play with the code to explore the topics we cover and to write your own code! \n"

    "\n",
    "NumPy is _the_ python package for doing scientific computing.  That is, if you want to write programs that use vectors and matrices, you'll be using NumPy. It includes lots of efficient methods for calculating various types of functions (e.g. trig functions like sin, cos, exp) and applying them to variable sized vectors and matrices.  If you're used to using R or Matlab, you'll probably find it very familiar. If you go on to do more machine learning you'll definitely use NumPy (or packages based on it) a lot, so it's well worth getting to know.  But for this course, knowing the basics just make the code blocks a little more interpretable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a comprehensive python visualization package that works well with NumPy. It is vast and complicated and we will not use that much of it's capabilities in these notebooks.  But again, you'll likely see this used in examples of plotting graphs with python in many speech processing related code bases. So, being able to recognize it's basic syntax will be helpful, but you definitely don't need to know much about this to use these notebooks.  \n",

You don't need to understand the workings of the code and you definitely won't need to reproduce it.

There is no specific assignment for _phon_ and  _signals_ modules aside from the class test, but there are assignments for the _TTS_ and _ASR_ components of the course and you will want to draw on your phonetics and signal processing knowledge when doing those.  \n",
