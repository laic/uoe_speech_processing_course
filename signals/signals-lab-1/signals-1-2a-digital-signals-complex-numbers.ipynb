    "    <strong>Terminology warning</strong>: In the code below, I've often referred to the complex sinusoid (i.e., the rotating 'clockhand' vector) as the <strong>\"phasor\"</strong>. This is actually an <em>inaccurate</em> use of terminology.  A phasor is defined as a single complex number which tells you how to scale and shift a complex sinusoid (rotating in time, magnitude 1, no phase shift) to get the sinusoid you want.  So, technically a phasor tells you the sinusoid's magnitude and phase, but it doesn't tell you anything about the frequency (so doesn't fully characterise the sinusoid). But in the code below <tt>phasor</tt> generally refers to the points in the complex plane that the corresponding complex sinusoid would sample (because it was easier than writing \"complex sinusoid\" all the time).\n",
